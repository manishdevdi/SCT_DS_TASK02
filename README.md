# SCT_DS_TASK02(Data Science Intern)
## Task02 : Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

# Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The objective is to explore the relationships between different variables, identify patterns, and uncover insights into the survival rates and other key metrics.

## Features

- Data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables.
- Visualization of relationships between variables (e.g., age, gender, class, survival).
- Insights into the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including:
- Age
- Gender
- Passenger Class
- Fare
- Survival Status
